This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage an Expo project, specifically when using the `expo prebuild` command.  The error message is vague and unhelpful, often indicating a problem with the build process but not specifying the root cause.  This can be frustrating as it leads to extensive troubleshooting.  The exact error message may vary depending on the project setup and environment, but it usually involves a failure to generate or process necessary build artifacts.
